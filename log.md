# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Build simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python.

**Thoughts:** I'm just getting started in using VIM and python. I built a simple rock, paper, scissors game in python which was much easier than I thought. Most of my issues were getting used to Python syntax since I'm switching from JavaScript. Now that I've got my feet wet, I'm going to start buildig a web scrapping script in Python tmrw. I'm excited!

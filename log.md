# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Build simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python.

**Thoughts:** I'm just getting started in using VIM and python. I built a simple rock, paper, scissors game in python which was much easier than I thought. Most of my issues were getting used to Python syntax since I'm switching from JavaScript. Now that I've got my feet wet, I'm going to start buildig a web scraping script in Python tmrw. I'm excited!

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Build simple client/server in Python.

**Thoughts:** So today was interesting, I created a simple server and client locally in Python and that was successful. Then I tried sending and recieving things from the server/client(browser/localhost). It wasn't working for a while but then I curled it and that worked. Still not to sure why in the browser I was getting a 404 and my server would die but when I curled it was working totally fine. *scratches head ... Didn't exactly get to the web scraping that I wanted to do, but there's always tommorrow. We'll see how that goes.
